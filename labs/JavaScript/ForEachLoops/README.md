# _for-each_ loops 

## Introduction
In this lab you will apply _for-each_ loops to manipulate a hand of cards.  

## Your Tasks

- [ ] Locate the "for-each loops" lab guide [ForEachLoops.pdf](ForEachLoops.pdf)

- [ ] Complete the group portion of the lab as instructed

- [ ] Complete the individual portion of the lab

	* Inside your main website directory, make sure you have created the following directory, 
		- ForEachLoops
	* Inside this directory, download and save the following
		- [files/CardCountAndSort/Index.html](files/CardCountAndSort/Index.html) - the html page that will display your program
		- [files/CardCountAndSort/App.js](files/CardCountAndSort/App.js) - the file you will complete
		- [files/CardCountAndSort/Card.js](files/CardCountAndSort/Card.js) - the Card API you will implement
		- [files/CardCountAndSort/DeckOfCards.js](files/CardCountAndSort/DeckOfCards.js) - the DeckOfCards API you will implement
	* Create a folder called "images" - must be lowercase
	* Inside the images directory download all of the images located here (or simply cut and paste the images from the previous lab)

### Challenge 1

- [ ] Complete the sumDealt function located in [files/App.js](files/CardCountAndSort/App.js). The sumDealt function sums the values of all the cards in the dealt hand and returns the total

### Challenge 2

- [ ] Complete the countSuits function located in [files/App.js](files/CardCountAndSort/App.js). The countSuits function counts the number of hearts, spades, clubs, and diamonds.  The function returns an array called suits where,
 		- index 0 represents the total number of hearts, 
		- index 1 represents the total number of spades
		- index 2 represents the total number of clubs
		- index 3 represents the total number of diamonds

### Challenge 3

- [ ] Complete the countValues function located in [files/App.js](files/CardCountAndSort/App.js). The countValues function counts the number of cards with a value of 1, 2, 3, etc. The function returns an array called values where,
		- index 1 represents the total number of cards with a value of 1 
		- index 2 represents the total number of cards with a value of 2
		- index 3 represents the total number of cards with a value of 3
		- etc.

### Challenge 4

- [ ] Implement the minCardToFront function located in [files/App.js](files/CardCountAndSort/App.js).  The minToFront function must move the lowest card to the front of the dealt array.  The resultant array of cards should then display on the page.

### EXTRA CREDIT

- [ ] Implement the sortCards() function located in [files/App.js](files/CardCountAndSort/App.js).  The sortCards() function should sort all the cards from lowest to highest.  The resultant array of cards should then display on the page.
