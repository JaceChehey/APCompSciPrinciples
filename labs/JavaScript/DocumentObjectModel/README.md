### Challenge 1

- [ ] Navigate to a site of your choosing.  Right click and inspect the site.  Then apply your javascript skills to modify the site to make it your own!  You MUST modify at least 6 elements on the page. Three elements should be modified using _.innerHTML_.  Three elements should be modified using _.style_.

### Challenge 2

- [ ] Explore the Index.html page you downloaded.  Then, in the App.js file write code that will enable a user to customize your page - see the example I have provided in this file.  For every element specified with an _id_ you must prompt the user for a style or text, then use this information to customize the page.  Feel free to get as creative as you like!  Below is a list of all the id elements you must modify, 

	* body
	* id = "foodLogoImage"
	* id = "description"
	* id = "nav"
	* id = "logoImage"
	* id = "content"
	* id = "header"
	* id = "burgerImage"
	* id = "main"
	* id = "button"
	* id = "nutrition"
