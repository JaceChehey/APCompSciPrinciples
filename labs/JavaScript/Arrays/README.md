# Arrays 

## Introduction
In this lab you will manipulate arrays to sort a hand of cards.  You will also complete an app that displays your favorite things!  

## Your Tasks

- [ ] Locate the "Arrays" lab guide [Arrays.pdf](Arrays.pdf)

- [ ] Complete the group portion of the lab as instructed

- [ ] Complete the individual portion of the lab

	* Inside your main website directory, make sure you have created the following directory, 
		- Arrays
	* Inside this directory, create two more directories
		- Name the first directory "CardSort"
		- Name the second directory "MyFavoriteThings"
	* Inside the CardSort directory, download and save the following
		- All the card images from the previous lab in a directory called "images". They are also located here [https://github.com/hpluska/APCompSciPrinciples/tree/master/labs/JavaScript/IfElseStatements/files/images](https://github.com/hpluska/APCompSciPrinciples/tree/master/labs/JavaScript/IfElseStatements/files/images)
		- [files/CardSort/Index.html](files/CardSort/Index.html) - the html page that will display your program
		- [files/CardSort/App.js](files/CardSort/App.js) - the file you will complete
		- [files/CardSort/Card.js](files/CardSort/Card.js) - the required Card API
		- [files/CardSort/DeckOfCards.js](files/DeckOfCards.js) - the required DeckOfCards API
	* Inside the MyFavoriteThings directory, download and save the following
		- [files/MyFavoriteThings/Index.html](files/MyFavoriteThings/Index.html) - the html page that will display your program
		- [files/MyFavoriteThings/App.js](files/MyFavoriteThings/App.js) - the file you will complete
		- [files/MyFavoriteThings/FavThingsGUI.js](files/MyFavoriteThings/FavThingsGUI.js) - the Graphical User Interface (GUI) you will implement

### Challenge 1

- [ ] Implement the minCardToFront function located in [files/CardSort/App.js](files/CardSort/App.js).  The minToFront function must move the lowest card to the front of the dealt array.  The resultant array of cards should then display on the page.  

### Challenge 2

- [ ] Implement all the TODOS located in [files/MyFavoriteThings/App.js](files/MyFavoriteThings/App.js).  Your final program should work exactly as describe in the lab guide. 

### EXTRA CREDIT

- [ ] Implement the sortCards() function located in [files/CardSort/App.js](files/CardSort/App.js).  The sortCards() function should sort all the cards from lowest to highest.  The resultant array of cards should then display on the page.
