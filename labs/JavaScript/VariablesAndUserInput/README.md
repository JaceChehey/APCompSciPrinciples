# Variables and Getting User Input

## Introduction
In the lab you will apple the var key word to create variables.  You will also apply prompts to gather user input and use these in a program. 

## Your Tasks

- [ ] Locate the "VariablesAndUserInput lab guide [VariablesAndUserInput.pdf](VariablesAndUserInput.pdf)

- [ ] Complete the group portion of the lab as instructed

- [ ] Complete the individual portion of the lab

	* Inside your main website directory, make sure you have created the following directory, 
		- VariablesAndUserInput
	* Inside this directory, create a new file called _App.js_
	* Inside this directory, create a file called _Index.html_
	* In the Index.html page you just created, cut and paste the following code, 

```
<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html> 
<head>
    <script src="App.js"></script>
</head>
</html>

```
	* Implement the challenge below
	* Show your completed challenge to Ms. Pluska to receive credit for the individual portion of this lab

### Challenge 1

- [ ] In your App.js file, debug the following code segments

	```
	var apples = 7;
	console.log(Aples);
	var Oranges = 13;
	console.log(oranges);
	```
	```
	var score = 7;
	console.log("The value of score is:");
	console.log("score");
	var lives = 20;
	console.log (The value of lives is:);
	console.log ("lives");
	```
	```
	var firstName = "Wigglesworth";
	console.log ("firstName");
	var firstName = "Jug Head";
	var lastName = "Jones";
	console.log (firstName + lastName);
	```
	The code below, does not print what is expected.  In a comment block in your App.js file explain why

	```
	var firstNumber = prompt("Enter a number");
	var secondNumber = prompt("Enter a another number");
	console.log("The sum of the numbers are " + firstNumber + secondNumber);
	```
### Challenge 2

- [ ] Complete the following 

	- Create three variables – “problem1”, “problem2”, “problem3”.
	- Assign the calculated value for each of the following to each problem respectively, 
	```
	Problem 1: 79 + 3 * (4 + 82 – 68) -7 + 19
	Problem 2: (179 + 21 + 10)/7 + 181
	Problem 3: 10389 * 56 * 11 + 2246
	```
	- Print the equation to the console, then catenate the answer to the end.
