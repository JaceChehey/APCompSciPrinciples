    <h1> My Hobbies </h3>>

    <h2> Soccer /h2>
    <h4> 5 years </h4>
    <p>Soccer is an awesome sport because you get to
    play on a team with all your friends. I love
    challenge of learning new skills like headers
    and corner kicks.

    <h2>Baking<h6>
    <h4> 10 years <h4>>
    I love baking because you put together all 
    these things that look simple and boring on 
    their own to make something magical and 
    delicious. I also love how baked things make 
    people happy. Sharing things I bake might be 
    the best part of it! <</p>

    <h2>Drawing</h1>
    <p>2 years</p> 
    <<p>On the weekend sometimes I got outside and try
    to draw what I see. My favorite thing to draw
    are buildings. /p>
