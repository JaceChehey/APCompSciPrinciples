## Introduction
In this lab you will use the table, th, and td tags to create tables.  Additionally you will apply the colspan and rowspan attributes.

## Your Tasks

- [ ] Locate the "Tables" lab guide [Tables.pdf](Tables.pdf)

- [ ] Complete the group portion of the lab as instructed

- [ ] Complete the individual portion of the lab

	* If you haven't already done so, on your desktop create a new directory (aka, folder) called MyWebsite
	* Inside your MyWebsite directory, create another directory called "Tables"
	* Inside your Tables directory, create a new file called Index.html

### Challenge 1

- [ ] Copy and paste the code below into your Index.html file

```
<!DOCTYPE>
<html>
<head>
<title>Tables</title>
<body>
	<h1>Challenge 1</h1> 
 
	<h3>My Weekly Schedule</h3> 
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Time</th>
			<th>Monday</th>
			<th>Tuesday</th>
			<th>Wednesday</th>
			<th>Thursday</th>
			<th>Friday</th>
			<th>Saturday</th>
			<th>Sunday</th>

- [ ] Create more rows.  Each row will represent a different 1 hour increment.  You can begin at any time you want, but you must include 24 rows - 1 for each hour of the day. 

- [ ] Create a weekly schedule.  Use the colspan and rowspan attributes to block out activities which span multiple row and/or columns.  For example, school, sleep.  Also be sure to use the bgcolor attribute to make your schedule more readable.
