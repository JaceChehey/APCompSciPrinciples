# Week 2: April 12 thru April 18

## Introduction

Hopefully you have all thought of a project you would like to create for your *Create Task*.  If you are stuck, go to Piazza and see what others have posted - there are plenty of ideas to get you thinking!  

The requirements of your *Create Task*, as taken from College Board, are described below, 

> Your program must demonstrate a variety of capabilities and implement several different langage features that, when combined, produce a result that cannot be easily accomplished without computing tools and techiniques.  Your program should draw upon mathematical and logical concepts, such as use of numbers, varialbes, mathematical expressions with arithmetic operators, logical and Boolean operators and expressions, decision statements, iteration, and/or collections.

> Your program must demonstrate: 

> * Use of several effectively integrated mathematical and logical concepts, from the language you are using;
> * Implementation of an algorithm that integrates two or more algorithms and integrates mathematical and/or logical concepts; and
> * development and use of abstractions to manage the complexity of your program (e.g., procedures, abstraction provided by the programming language, APIs).

Whoa!  TMI.  This week we will just focus on the algorithm bit.  An *Algorithm* is a set of steps you can write that allows a computer to solve a problem.  

## Your Tasks

- [ ] Watch the video below, What is an algorithm and why should I care

    * [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvSOaYi89B4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvSOaYi89B4) 

- [ ] Think about one problem you need to solve in your program.  For example, maybe you're are writing a memory game.  And, your game begins by displaying a set of cards - some of which are duplicates - to the user, then hides them.  How are you going to do this?  You need to write an *algorithm* for displaying the cards.  You also need an *algorithm* that decides how many duplicate cards there are and where they should be placed on the screen. 

- [ ] Your task this week is to write and share one *algorithm* that you wrote.  The algorithm you write must solve a problem in your program. You must also be able to explain how your algorithm works.
