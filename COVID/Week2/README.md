# Week 2: April 12 thru April 18

## Introduction

Hopefully you have all thought of a project you would like to create for your *Create Task*.  If you are stuck, go to Piazza and see what others have posted - there are plenty of ideas to get you thinking!  

The requirements of your *Create Task*, as taken from College Board, are described below, 

> Your program must demonstrate a variety of capabilities and implement several different langage features that, when combined, produce a result that cannot be easily accomplished without computing tools and techiniques.  Your program should draw upon mathematical and logical concepts, such as use of numbers, varialbes, mathematical expressions with arithmetic operators, logical and Boolean operators and expressions, decision statements, iteration, and/or collections.

> Your program must demonstrate: 

> * Use of several effectively integrated mathematical and logical concepts, from the language you are using;
> * Implementation of an algorithm that integrates two or more algorithms and integrates mathematical and/or logical concepts; and
> * development and use of abstractions to manage the complexity of your program (e.g., procedures, abstraction provided by the programming language, APIs).

Whoa!  TMI.  This week will just focus on the algorithm bit.  An *Algorithm* is a set of steps you can write that allows a computer to solve a problem.  

## Your Tasks

- [ ] Review the videos below.  These are videos of *Create Tasks* previously submitted by students just like you to college board.  Keep in mind that while these projects were likely created in other languages they could be recreated in pure javascript. Also, keep in mind that any of the programs below could earn you a "5" on the AP Exam!  What determines your score is *not* the complexity of the program, it is how well you document your program and the development process in the narrative - but, more on that later!

- [ ] Create a new text document.  In the document, complete the following prompts,

    *   What is your first and last name?  You must indicate this, or I cannot give you credit!   
    *   What is the name of your program
    *   What is the purpose of your program
    *   Brainstorm the steps you will take to complete your program (if you already started your program, indicated what you have completed so far and how you will complete the remainder).  This should be fairly detailed and specific - it should make sense to someone with comparable skills.  Feel free to include preliminary code in your brainstorm as well.  Keep in mind that this is just a brainstorm - you can always change course later!

- [ ] Submit your *Create Task* proposal

    *   Navigate to [http://github.com](http://github.com) and create an account
    *   Navigate to [https://classroom.github.com/a/9xe4cG4E](https://classroom.github.com/a/9xe4cG4E) to submit this assignment
        *   Accept the assignment
        *   Click on the repository link
