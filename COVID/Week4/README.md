# Week 4: April 26 thru May 2

## Introduction

Hopefully all of you are making progress on your *Create Task*.  If you are having issues, head over to Piazza and create a post.  

This week's lesson is going to focus on the following *Create Task* requirement, 

> Develop an abstraction that manages the complexity of your program

Believe it or not we have dealt with abstractions a lot over the course of the year. An abstraction is something in our program that helps manage its complexity. Or, to put it simply, it's just a function.   But, it could also be more.  For example, when you created cards using the Card API, you could integrate cards in your program without worrying about how the Card API worked.  In otherwords, the Card API managed the complexity of creating the cards.  

## Your Tasks

- [ ] Watch the video on abstractions.  Although the platform being used in the video is different, you should get the idea.

- [ ] Your task this week is to share an abstraction you have included in your program on Piazza.  The abstraction you share must be your own and be different than the algorithms you shared previously.   You must also explain how your abstraction handles the complexity of your program.
