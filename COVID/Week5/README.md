# Week 5: May 3 thru May 9

## Introduction

Hopefully all of you are making progress on your *Create Task*.  If you are having issues, head over to Piazza and create a post.  

This week's lesson is going to focus on completing the written reflection required for this task.  I realize most of you probably have not completed your create task, but as long as you have been following along with the weekly lessons, you should be able to complete the written reflection. Once this is done, only need to finalize your code and a create a brief video of your program.
