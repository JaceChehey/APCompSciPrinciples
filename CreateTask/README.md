# AP Computer Science Principles Create Task

## Create Task Overview

This performance task requires you to develop a program on a topic that interests
you or one that solves a problem. During the completion of this performance task,
you will iteratively design, implement, and test your program. You will provide
written responses to prompts about your program and specific program code that
are significant to the functionality of your program. It is strongly recommended that
a portion of the program involve some form of collaboration with another student in
your class, for example, in the planning, designing, or testing (debugging) part of
the development process. Your program development must also involve a significant
amount of independent work writing your program code, in particular, algorithm(s)
and abstraction(s) that you select to use as part of your written response to describe
how the program code segments help your program run.

You are required to, 

* Independently develop an algorithm that integrates two or more algorithms and
that is fundamental for your program to achieve its intended purpose;
* Develop an abstraction that manages the complexity of your program;
* Create a video that displays the running of your program and demonstrates its
functionality;
* Write responses to all the prompts in the performance task; and
* Submit your entire program code.

## Program Requirements

Your program must demonstrate a variety of capabilities and implement several
different language features that, when combined, produce a result that cannot be
easily accomplished without computing tools and techniques. Your program should
draw upon mathematical and logical concepts, such as use of numbers, variables,
mathematical expressions with arithmetic operators, logical and Boolean operators
and expressions, decision statements, iteration, and/or collections.
Your program must demonstrate:

* Use of several effectively integrated mathematical and logical concepts, from the
language you are using;
* Implementation of an algorithm that integrates two or more algorithms and integrates
mathematical and/or logical concepts; and
* Development and use of abstractions to manage the complexity of your program
(e.g., procedures, abstractions provided by the programming language, APIs).

## Create task reflection

## Screen cast of your program

Create a 30 - 60 second screen cast of your program or a significant feature of your program.  Your recording MUST be a screen cast, not a video recorded of your screen using your phone or another device. I recommend the screencastify (or similar application)

## Grading Rubric

## Submitting your project

Before you submit your project, make sure it is the project you intend to submit for grading both by Ms. Pluska and the College Board - __Revisions on this project will NOT be accepted__. 

__Your completed project must be submitted to College Board by April 30__.  This is the deadline imposed by the College Board, not Ms. Pluska.
